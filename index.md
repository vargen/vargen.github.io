# **CI Fuzz Docs**
Welcome to the Code Intelligence docs for CI Fuzz. This page will help you with getting started using CI Fuzz, Code Intelligence's flagship product. CI Fuzz is a collection of tools that enable you to quickly and easily write fuzz tests and then deploy them either locally or integrate them into your existing CICD pipeline. 

## Getting Started with CI Fuzz CLI

If you have never written a fuzz test before, or even if you have, then the CI Fuzz CLI is a great tool to know. The CI Fuzz CLI, known simply as `cifuzz`, is a command line tool that helps you to integrate and run fuzz tests in your project. It currently supports C/C++ fuzz testing.

Get started with fuzzing here: [CI Fuzz CLI]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/ci-fuzz-cli/index.md %}).
