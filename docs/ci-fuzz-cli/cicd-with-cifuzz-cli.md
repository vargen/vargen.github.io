# **Getting to DevSecOps - CI/CD integration**

Once you have developed and tested your fuzz test(s), the next step we recommend is automating the testing with CI/CD. This includes running nightly fuzzing campaigns and catching bugs with pull request fuzzing to minimize their impact.

Your CI engineer will work with you to help plan and implement an automated CI/CD fuzzing setup based on your requirements and existing infrastructure.
